# GithubRepositories

Simple application to search for github repository, and display details of it.

## Development server

After `npm install` you can run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

The application was created with angular-cli, so you can use `ng test` and `ng e2e` to run unit tests and end-to-end tests.
