\- written by Tibor Botos

## Development server

After `npm install` you can run `ng serve` for a dev server. The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`

This was created with angular-cli, so you can use `ng test` and `ng e2e` to run unit tests and end-to-end tests. 

Step by step guide:

```
git clone git@github.com:tiborbotos/github-repositories.git
cd github-repositories
npm install
ng serve
// and for the tests
ng test
ng e2e
```
